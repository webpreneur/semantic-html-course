# Why are you here?

Shortly. In order to never ever write such (markup) code like this in the future.

```html
    <div id="header"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="article">
            <div class="figure">
                <img>
                <div class="figcaption"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="footer"></div>
```

After this course you will write your code from above in a way like this:

```html
    <header></header>
    <section>
        <article>
            <figure>
                <img>
                <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </article>
    </section>
    <footer></footer>
```

Sidenote: if you prefer the former one, maybe this course is suits your needs :)
