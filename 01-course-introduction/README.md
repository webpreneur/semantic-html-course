# Why are you here?

Shortly. In order to never ever write such (markup) code like this in the future.

```html
    <div id="header"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="article">
            <div class="figure">
                <img>
                <div class="figcaption"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="footer"></div>
```

After this course you will write your code from above in a way like this:

```html
    <header></header>
    <section>
        <article>
            <figure>
                <img>
                <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </article>
    </section>
    <footer></footer>
```

Sidenote: if you prefer the former one, maybe this course is suits your needs :)


## Why would you do this?

* To write more human and machine readable code
* To excel at job interviews

## Better Search Engine Rankings

The web crawlers (search-engine spiders) are dependent on the semantic clarity of the web pages.

## Better Accessibility

Good semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents. For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.


Bring out the meaning of your web pages and applications by the correct use of semantic markup wherever possible.
