                    <dt>Are McDonald's veggie dippers gluten free?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes, but only without the bun of course. 
                        The  Pepper & Pesto Dipper itself has no gluten 
                        containing ingredients and is cooked in a separate fryer, 
                        away from other ingredients containing gluten.

                        Unfortunately, we don't have enough space in our kitchens 
                        to accommodate the cooking and preparation 
                        of our breakfast and main menus at the same time.
