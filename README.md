# Semantic HTML Mastery Course

## Write Readable HTML

There is another big advantage of actually using all those HTML5 elements: If building a complex site, it will ease CSS markup a lot! **You'll be able to reduce the use of classes and IDs, and build better context-dependent styles**. And if you do so, see to it, that you use these elements in a semantically correct way.

## The Problem...

The problem is that a lot of (frontend) web developer writes very poor HTML code.
